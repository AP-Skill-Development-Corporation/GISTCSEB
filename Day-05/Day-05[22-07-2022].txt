Day-05[22-07-2022]:
===================
	Good Morning to All...

	Form Methods:
	=============
	> GET
	> POST
		GET:
		====
		> By default the form method is get
		> While submitting the form it displays the sensitive information in browser url
		> It stores less amount of data to submit to a file

		POST:
		=====
		> Secure Form submission is POST because it doesnt display the sensitive information to a user
		> In this we need to use "{% csrf_token %}" to send the data from html file to server i.e., views
		> It stores large amount of data that cant be viewed in the url of a browser

	Form Configuration:
	===================
	> If we need to send the data from form we need to use the method such as either "get" or "post"
	> In form for every input we need to use names to access or to submit the values from the names to a server
	> After submitting the form then we need to access the from dat to server for that we need to check the method first either it is "get" or "post"
	> In views we need to store the form data to a local variable by accessing the vale from a post method from a form such as
		ex:
			def functionname(re):
				if re.method == "POST":
					d = re.POST['n']
					render(re,'../.html',{'key':value})
				return render(re,'../.html')
	> To access the data from views we need to send the data in dictonary format to a .html file
	> To access the data in .html we need to access by using DTL Language such as "{{keyname}}"

	Bootstrap 4:
	============
	> To create responsive webpages
	> To reduce human work for designing the .html file
	> We can use one or more selector properties by using the class
	> It has 2 modes to access 
		> Online => need internet
		> Offline => we need to download the zip file and to place it in static folder inside of css and vice-versa

	Bootstrap Components:
	=====================
	> container => Provides space for left and right of web page
	> container-fluid => It doesnt provide any space it fills entire width of html
	> jumbotron => IT displays the data but background color will be in grey color
	> grid system => To align the columns and to resize for all type of devices

	Grid system:
	============
	> It consists of 12 columns
	> Columns can be divided based on user specified columns
	> Based on resolution of devices it has categorised in to 5 Devices reponsiveness they are:
		>> xm => very small
		>> sm => small
		>> md => medium
		>> lg => large
		>> xl => extra large
	> It consiste of columns and rows

	Points:
	=======
	> Based on the pixels here bootstrap has assignined for each and every pixels so they categorised in to points they are from "1" to "5"
	> for each and every point the pixels are changed based on user specification we need to use the points
	> It can be accessed for any alignments

	Margins:
	========
	> m => for all directions
	> ml => margin left
	> mr => margin right
	> mt => margin top
	> mb => margin bottom
	> mx => margins for x axis [i.e., left and right]
	> my => margins for y axis [i.e., top and bottom]

	Paddings:
	=========
	> p => for all directions
	> pl => padding left
	> pr => padding right
	> pt => padding top
	> pb => padding bottom
	> px => padding for x axis [i.e., left and right]
	> py => padding for y axis [i.e., top and bottom]

	Styling used in today class:
	============================
	> text-center
	> bg-primary
	> text-light
	> border rounded
	> shadow-lg
	> btn btn-outline-primary
	> col-sm
	> card
	Database:
	=========
	> To store the data temporarily for further actions like
		>> Create
		>> Read
		>> Update
		>> Delete

	ORM [Object Relational Mapper]:
	===============================
	> Try these ORM Queries in shell it is a service in manage.py file
	> First we need to create a class to create a table such as
		>> class Classname(models.Model):
			fieldname = models.datatype(attributes)
	> Here in ORM we are using the different fields such as
		>> CharField => text
		>> DateField => date
		>> FloatField => float values
		>> TimeField => time
		>> FileField => files
		>> ImageField => images
		So we can assign the data type based on the field names
	> After completing the class name in models.py then we need to create an interfacing files to create a table
	> To create an interfacing file then we need to type some commands in command prompt for first interfacing file we can observe the file name such as "0001_initial.py" and other file name based on alter of the data type or a fieldname in a class
	> For creating an interfacing file we need to type the command such as
		>> manage.py makemigrations
	> After creating the interfacing file we need to update all those tavle or field by using the "migrate" command
		>> manage.py migrate
		Here all the migrations had done and our table also created with the name such as
			>> "appname_classname"
			In database we can observe the table in this format
	> Finally the database with our own table has been created

	ORM Queries:
	============
	> open command prompt where manage.py file exists
	> Then we need to start the shell by using the command as
		>> manage.py shell
	> Here we need to import the classname to shell so the command is
		>> from appname.models import classname
	> Then the classname is imported if not then you are accessing the wrong package or module

	Display fields:
	===============
	> In shell try to type command to dispaly fieldname which are created in class
		>> classname.__doc__
			or
		>> classname._meta.get_fields()
	> This two commands will displays the fields and its data types that are created for that class or table

	Inserting a Record [Create]:
	============================
	> To insert a record we need to follow the procedures they are
		>> save
		>> create
		>> bulk_create
	> So the syntax to insert a record is
		>> objectname = classname(fieldname=value,......)
		>> objectname.save()
		In save method we need to use save() for saving the record if not it will not insert into a database
	> Create method doesnt require save method the syntax for create is
		>> objectname = classname.objects.create(fieldname=value,.....)
		So after executing this command it will insert record into a database
	> Bulk create is used to insert single or more records by using the syntax such as
		>> objectname = classname.objects.bulk_create([classname(fieldname=value,....),classname(fieldname=value,..),...])
		Here the n number of records will save it in database so here also we didnt need any save method

	Accesing a record[Reading]:
	===========================
	> To display a record we can use in different ways such as by accessing the single record or n number of records
		>> get
		>> filter
		>> first
		>> last
		>> all
	> get:
		In get we need to access unique values if the record is not in a database it will displays as error
		ex:
			objectname = classname.objects.get(fieldname=value)
	> filter:
		In filter we can access duplicate values if the record is not in a database it returns empty
		ex:
			objectname = classname.objects.filter(fieldname=value)
	> first:
		In first it displays the first record of a database
		ex:
			objectname = classname.objects.first()
	> last:
		In last it displays the last record of a database
		ex:
			objectname = classname.objects.last()
	> all:
		It displays all data
		ex:
			objectname = classname.objects.all()
	> slicing:
		It can displays the data from and to
		ex:
			objectname = classname.objects.all()[start:stop]
	> displaying particular field value
		>> objectname = classname.objects.all()
		>> objectname.fieldname
	> Displaying n number of records by using loop
		ex:
			for iterationvariablename in objectname:
				print(iterationvariablename.fieldname)

	Update:
	=======
	> To update a record we need to use the command for that we need gto access the record by using get method
		ex:
		  objectname = classname.objects.get(fieldname=value)
		  objectname.fieldname = value

	Delete:
	=======
	> To Delete a record we need to use the command
		ex:
		  => Single record delete
		  objectname = classname.objects.get(fieldname=value)
		  objectname.delete()

		  => Multiple records
		  objectname = classname.objects.filter(fieldname=value)
		  objectname.delete()

		  => All data deletion in a table
		  objectname = classname.objects.all()
		  objectname.delete()

		  => To delete record in a single row
		  objectname = classname.objects.all().delete()
